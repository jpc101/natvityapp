<h1>The First Noel</h1>

<p>The first noel the angel did say<br />
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;<br />
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,<br />
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.</p>

<p class="chorus">Noel, noel, noel, noel,<br />
Born is the King of Israel!</p>

<p>They looked up and saw a star<br />
Shining in the east, beyond them far,<br />
And to the earth it gave great light,<br />
And so it continued both day and night.</p>

<p>And by the light of that same star<br />
Three wise men came from country far;<br />
To seek for a King was their intent,<br />
And to follow the star wherever it went.</p>

<p>This star drew nigh to the north-west;<br />
Over Bethlehem it took its rest,<br />
And there it did both stop and stay<br />
Right over the place where Jesus lay.</p>

<p>Then entered in those wise men three<br />
Full reverently upon their knee,<br />
And offered there in His presence<br />
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.</p>

<p>Then let us all with one accord<br />
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,<br />
That hath made heaven and earth of nought,<br />
And with His blood mankind hath bought. </p>
