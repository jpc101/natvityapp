<h1>Do You Hear What I Hear?</h1>

<p>Said the night wind to the little lamb,<br />
"Do you see what I see?<br />
Way up in the sky, little lamb,<br />
Do you see what I see?<br />
A star, a star, dancing in the night<br />
With a tail as big as a kite,<br />
With a tail as big as a kite." </p>

<p>Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy,<br />
"Do you hear what I hear?<br />
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy,<br />
Do you hear what I hear?<br />
A song, a song high above the trees<br />
With a voice as big as the the sea,<br /> 
With a voice as big as the the sea."</p>

<p>Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,<br />
"Do you know what I know?<br /> 
In your palace warm, mighty king,<br /> 
Do you know what I know?<br /> 
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold<br />
Let us bring him silver and gold,<br /> 
Let us bring him silver and gold."</p>

<p>Said the king to the people everywhere,<br /> 
"Listen to what I say!<br /> 
Pray for peace, people, everywhere,<br />
Listen to what I say!<br />
The Child, the Child sleeping in the night<br />
He will bring us goodness and light,<br />
He will bring us goodness and light."</p>
