<h1>I Saw Three Ships</h1>

<p>I saw three ship come sailing in,<br />
On Christmas day on Christmas day.<br />
I saw three ship come sailing in,<br />
On Christmas Day in the morning.</p>

<p>And what was in those ships all three?<br />
On Christmas day on Christmas day.<br />
And what was in those ships all three?<br />
On Christmas Day in the morning. </p>

<p>Our Saviour Christ and His lady,<br />
On Christmas day on Christmas day.<br />
Our Saviour Christ and His lady,<br />
On Christmas Day in the morning. </p>

<p>And where they sailed those ships all three?<br />
On Christmas day on Christmas day.<br />
And where they sailed those ships all three?<br />
On Christmas Day in the morning. </p>

<p>All they sailed in to Bethlehem,<br />
On Christmas day on Christmas day.<br />
All they sailed in to Bethlehem,<br />
On Christmas Day in the morning. </p>

<p>And all the bells on earth shall ring,<br />
On Christmas day on Christmas day.<br />
And all the bells on earth shall ring,<br />
On Christmas Day in the morning. </p>

<p>And all the angels in heaven shall sing,<br />
On Christmas day on Christmas day.<br />
And all the the angels in heaven shall sing,<br />
On Christmas Day in the morning. </p>

<p>And all the souls on earth shall sing,<br />
On Christmas day on Christmas day.<br />
And all the souls on earth shall sing,<br />
On Christmas Day in the morning.</p>

<p>And let us all rejoice again,<br />
On Christmas day on Christmas day.<br />
And let us all rejoice again,<br />
On Christmas Day in the morning.</p>
