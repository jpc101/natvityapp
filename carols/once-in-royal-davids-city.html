<h1>Once in Royal David's City</h1>

<p>Once, in royal David's city,<br />
Stood a lowly cattle shed,<br />
Where a mother laid her baby<br />
In a manger for His bed.<br />
Mary was that mother mild,<br />
Jesus Christ, her little child.</p>

<p>He came down to earth from heaven,<br />
Who is God and Lord of all,<br />
And His shelter was a stable,<br />
And His cradle was a stall:<br />
With the poor and meek and lowly<br />
Lived on earth our Saviour holy.</p>

<p>And through all His wondrous childhood<br />
He would honour and obey,<br />
Love and watch the lowly mother<br />
In whose gentle arms He lay.<br />
Christian children all should be<br />
Mild, obedient, good as He.</p>

<p>For He is our childhood's pattern:<br />
Day by day like us He grew;<br />
He was little, weak and helpless;<br />
Tears and smiles like us He knew:<br />
And He feeleth for our sadness,<br />
And He shareth in our gladness.</p>

<p>And our eyes at last shall see Him<br />
Through His own redeeming love;<br />
For that child, so dear and gentle,<br />
Is our Lord in heaven above;<br />
And He leads His children on<br />
To the place where He is gone.</p>

<p>Not in that poor lowly stable,<br />
With the oxen standing by,<br />
We shall see Him, but in heaven,<br />
Set at God's right hand on high;<br />
When like stars His children crowned,<br />
All in white shall wait around. </p>
