<h1>It Came Upon the Midnight Clear</h1>

<p>It came upon the midnight clear,<br />
That glorious song of old,<br />
From angels bending near the earth<br />
To touch their harps of gold!<br />
'Peace on the earth, good will to men,'<br />
From heaven's all gracious King!<br />
The world in solemn stillness lay<br />
To hear the angels sing.</p>

<p>Still through the cloven skies they come<br />
With peaceful wings unfurled<br />
And still their heavenly music floats<br />
O'er all the weary world;<br />
Above its sad and lowly plains<br />
They bend on hovering wing.<br />
And ever o'er its Babel sounds<br />
The blessed angels sing.</p>

<p>Yet with woes of sin and strife<br />
The world has suffered long;<br />
Beneath the angel-strain have rolled<br />
Two thousand years of wrong;<br />
And man, at war with man, hears not<br />
The love song which they bring:<br />
O hush the noise, ye men of strife,<br />
And hear the angels sing.</p>

<p>And ye, beneath life's crushing load,<br />
Whose forms are bending low,<br />
Who toil along the climbing way<br />
With painful steps and slow,<br />
Look now! for glad and golden hours<br />
Come swiftly on the wing.<br />
O rest beside the weary road,<br />
And hear the angels sing!</p>

<p>For lo! the days are hastening on,<br />
By prophet bards foretold,<br />
When, with the ever-circling years,<br />
Shall come the age of gold;<br />
When peace shall over all the earth<br />
Its ancient splendors fling,<br />
And all the world give back the song<br />
Which now the angels sing. </p>
